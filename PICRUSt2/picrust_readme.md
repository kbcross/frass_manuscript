followed the PICRUSt2 tutorial: https://github.com/picrust/picrust2/wiki/PICRUSt2-Tutorial-(v2.5.2)

input tables for analysis when all families present were:
1. KC_Rarefied_L7.tsv
2. roach_frass_rep_otu_USE_noDup.fa

input tables for analysis when top 10 families were present were: 
1. KC_Rarefied_Top10_L7_USE.tsv
2. roach_frass_rep_otu_USE_noDup.fa

For alpha and beta diversity, the same R code was used as the composition analysis.

Output files (all families):

Output files (top 10 families):

Output files (contributing OTU to each pathway - all families):
1. otu_contrib_path_abun_unstrat.tsv.gz - this file has the abundance of contributing OTU's to each pathway for each sample.
